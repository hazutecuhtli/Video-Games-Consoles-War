In this project is presented an analysis of how good first-party video games developers are based on scores given to their video games. The motivation to this analysis is to understand if some first party developers are better than the others and if the rated scores given to their games depends on the video games genres or on the consoles where they are published.

## Libraries used
​
In this project the following libraries are used:
​
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikitlearn
- bs4
- os

## Additional functions used

Additionally, to the libraries used, the following functions developed are imported from the Function.py file:

- PCAvariance
- PCAcompWeights
- PCATest
- ClustersProportions
- PlottingGamesClusters
- DevStatistics
- GamesDeveloped

## Files contained in the repository

The files contained in the repository are the followings:

- Functions.py -  A file included the previously mentioned custom made functions
- VideoGames.ipynb - A python notebook with the code used to implement the mentioned analysis
- metacritic_game_info.csv - A csv file containing the data used for the analysis

### Summary of results obtained:

- Rates given by Metascore are different from rated given by video games players
- The way video games rates are clustered depending on their genres varies from the years, especially when considering the various video games console generations
- Video games developed by Nintendo are the best rated when considering all the obtained information
- When analysing how well video games from first-party developers are rated depending on the video game consoles Nintendo and Sony made the best-rated video games.
